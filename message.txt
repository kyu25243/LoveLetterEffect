Ever since you came into my life, you've made it brighter just by being in it and shining effortlessly everyday. even on the darkest nights, seeing your happiness and your light soothes my soul. 

even if the world only sees you as a fainting glimmer, you shine to me like a blazing sun that warms my world. so dont ever compare your light to anyone else's, because no matter how much the attention other stars in the sky receive, there is always hidden fainting stars in the distant that shine brighter than any other star in the sky. they are only perceived through eyes of people who see the actual beauty in them and who will to see them instead of for attention.

You are that star for me. and that's why dont ever think that you are not good enough, because only people who truly wish to see you as you are will know how amazing and beautiful you truly are.ðŸ’žðŸ’•ðŸ’žðŸ’•
